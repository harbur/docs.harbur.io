Harbur provide an easy way to find, share and distribute docker-based solution stacks. You have a cool docker-compose file that want to share with a fellow developer? You can simply upload it under your namespace and it can be run with a simple one-liner on any machine that runs docker using the Harbur CLI. You can use the service to centrally manage your docker-compose scripts across your clusterized environment and avoid the hassle of updating versions on distributed systems.

Colossus Overview
=================

Welcome to the Harbur Colossus Platform documentation!

Here you'll find information and resources to help you learn about Harbur Colossus Platform. From getting starting with creating your first app to using the advanced features, these resources explain how to setup and manage your Platform.

Colossus is layered architecture designed to compose a clustered Docker infrastructure ready to be used for development, testing or production environments. It focuses on easy maintenance, upgradability, and minimizing downtimes through redundancy and NO-SPOF (No Single Point of Failures), the base for creating a fault-tolerant, self-healing and scalable solution.

The Colossus is based on `CoreOS <https://coreos.com/>`_ for the Operating System, `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ for the Container Runtime, and `Consul <https://www.consul.io/>`_ for the Service Discovery.

For an overview of the Colossus components, check the :doc:`architecture/index` section.

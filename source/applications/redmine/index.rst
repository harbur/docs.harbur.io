Redmine
=======

What is Redmine
---------------

Redmine is a flexible project management web application. Written using the Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database. Redmine is open source and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL).

How is Redmine Prepared
-----------------------

In the Redmine installation we include the following preconfigurations:

Email configuration
-------------------

Redmine is preconfigured to use a dedicated email account for Redmine notifications. This way you don't have to setup anything from your side in order to get notifications by email.

Dedicated Domain Name
---------------------

We reserve a specific domain name for your Redmine and we configure Redmine with that domain name. This way Redmine can generate your email notifications with references to the public domain name.


Redmine Theme
-------------

Redmine is themable and we have dressed it appropriately! We have included by default the `Gitmike <https://github.com/makotokw/redmine-theme-gitmike>`__ theme.

In case you want to return to the default theme go to **Administration - Settings - Display** And update the Theme dropdown.

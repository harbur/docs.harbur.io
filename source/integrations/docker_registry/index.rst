Docker Registry
===============

In order to store the container images in a secure manner and make it possible to distribute them between machines we need a Docker Registry. The following docker registries are supported:

* `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_
* `Docker Trusted Registry <https://hub.docker.com/enterprise/>`_
* `Quay.io <http://quay.io/>`_
* `CoreOS Enterprise Registry <https://coreos.com/products/enterprise-registry/>`_

The provided CLM doesn't include Docker Registry. It is to be provided externally.

Operating System
================

The supported Operating System for the CLM is CoreOS. It is possible to extend the deployment infrastructure to heterogeneous operating systems in a way as illustrated below.

The external OS need to have docker installed and provide connectivity to the cluster using the Docker API. The management of the other Operating systems is not part of the CLM.
